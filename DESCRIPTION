Description: PONG is a modification of HIBAG and was designed to impute KIR3DL1/S1
	KIR3DL1/S1 alleles from chromosome 19 SNP data. PONG the R statistical programming language.
	We provide models built from the Global populations availible in the 1000 Genomes Project. 
	PONG leverages the functions built in HIBAG using attribute bagging and an 
	ensemble classifier method with haplotype inference for SNPs and KIR3DL1/S1 types. Please use
	with an R version < 4.0.
