	abstract = {Killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR) found on natural killer cells play an important role in mitigating infection and controlling cancer through innate immune response. The study of the immunogenetics of genes encoding KIR can be difficult due to structural variation and being an unusually highly polymorphic region. In medical genetics studies genes encoding KIR are often excluded as more expensive targeted sequencing approaches are needed to characterize alleles. In the current study we have modified HIBAG, a program designed to impute HLA alleles from whole genome SNP data, to do the same for alleles of KIR3DL1/S1. We have named this modification Pulling Out NK cell Genomics (PONG). We have built and optimized a model using the 1000 Genomes database to accurately impute KIR3DL1/S1. We show that PONG is effective at imputing common KIR3DL1/S1 alleles (frequency > 1%) across human diversity with an accuracy of 89% in African populations to 97% in East Asian Populations. As more data becomes available and incorporated into the model the imputation accuracy of the model will also improve. The use of PONG thus negates the need for targeted sequencing data in large scale association studies where such methods might not be tractable.},
